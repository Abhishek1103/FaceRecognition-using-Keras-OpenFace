# Face Recognition Using Keras-OpenFace

The implementation is inspired by two path breaking papers on facial recognition using deep convoluted neural network, namely FaceNet and DeepFace.
<br>
I have used pre trained model Keras-OpenFace which is an open source Keras implementation of the OpenFace (Originally Torch implemented).
The pretrained model that I have used is by Victor Sy Wang's implementation and was loaded using his code: https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace.
